# DSA3101 Minimising Stress from Course Deadlines

### Goal:

1. Reduce stress level of students by increasing awareness amongst module instructors on relevant deadlines and stress level of their students before and during the semester. By allowing instructors to have an overview, this would help facilitate coordination between different professors in deconflicting high stress periods that their students might face. 


2. We will also have an optimisation model that will help prompt the instructors to change the dates of specific tasks if their students are experiencing high stress levels on a particular day.
